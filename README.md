# Project: Set Operations

This project is a C++ program that allows the user to perform some basic set operations on two sets of integers. The user can enter the number of elements and the values of each set, and then choose from four operations: union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. The program will display the result of the operation and ask the user if they want to perform another operation.

## How to run the program

To run the program, you need a C++ compiler and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that supports C++. You can use any compiler and IDE of your choice, such as GCC and Visual Studio Code. 

To compile the program, open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the project file `setoperations.cpp`. Then type the following command:

`g++ -o setoperations setoperations.cpp`

This will create an executable file named `setoperations` in the same folder. To run the program, type the following command:

`./setoperations`

The program will prompt you to enter the number of elements and the values of each set. Then it will display a menu with four options: 1. A U B, 2. B n A, 3. A - B, and 4. B - A. The user can enter their choice and the program will display the result of the operation.

## How the program works

The program uses two arrays of integers to store the elements of each set. The size of the arrays is determined by the user input. The program uses a loop to ask the user to enter the values of each element and store them in the arrays.

The program then uses another loop and a switch statement to perform the chosen operation on the sets. The program uses the following logic for each operation:

- Union: The program prints the elements of the first set, and then prints the elements of the second set that are not in the first set. The program uses a flag variable to check if an element is already in the first set or not.
- Intersection: The program prints the elements that are common to both sets. The program uses a nested loop to compare each element of the first set with each element of the second set.
- Difference: The program prints the elements of the first set that are not in the second set. The program uses a flag variable to check if an element is in the second set or not.
- Symmetric difference: The program prints the elements that are in either set but not in both. The program uses a flag variable to check if an element is in the other set or not.

The program then asks the user if they want to perform another operation or exit.

## Limitations and improvements

The program has some limitations and possible improvements, such as:

- The program does not check for invalid input, such as non-numeric values, duplicate values, or values outside the range of the arrays. The program could use input validation techniques, such as `cin.fail()` or `try-catch` blocks, to handle errors and exceptions.
- The program does not allow the user to change the sets or the number of elements after entering them. The program could use dynamic memory allocation, such as `new` and `delete`, to create and modify the arrays at runtime.
- The program does not use any data structures, such as `set` or `vector`, to store and manipulate the sets. The program could use the STL (Standard Template Library) containers and algorithms, such as `set_union`, `set_intersection`, `set_difference`, or `set_symmetric_difference`, to simplify the code and improve the performance.
